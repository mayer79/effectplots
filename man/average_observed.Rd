average_observed(
  v,
  data,
  y,
  w = NULL,
  breaks = "Sturges",

\arguments{
\item{v}{Vector of variable names to be used on the x axis.}

\item{data}{Matrix-like.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector with observed values of the response.
Can also be a column name in \code{data}. Omitted if \code{NULL} (default).}

\item{w}{Optional vector with case weights. Can also be a column name in \code{data}.}

\item{breaks}{An integer, a vector, a string or a function specifying the bins
of \code{x}, and passed to \code{\link[graphics:hist]{graphics::hist()}}. The default is "Sturges".
\emph{Not} vectorized over \code{v}. Only relevant for numeric x.}

\item{right}{Should bins created via \code{\link[graphics:hist]{graphics::hist()}} be right-closed?
The default is \code{TRUE}. Vectorized over \code{v}. Only relevant for numeric x.}

\item{discrete_m}{Numeric x with up to this number of unique values
should be treated as factors. The default is 2. Vectorized over \code{v}.}

\item{wprob_low}{Small values of numeric x are capped at this quantile.
Set to 0 to avoid Winsorizing. Note that at most 100k observations are sampled
to calculate the quantile (depends on your random seed). Vectorized over \code{v}.}

\item{wprob_high}{High values of numeric x are capped at this quantile.
Set to 1 to avoid Winsorizing. Note that at most 100k observations are sampled
to calculate the quantile (depends on your random seed). Vectorized over \code{v}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused.}
}
\value{
If \code{v} has length 1, an object of class "marginal" containing these elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: data.frame containing statistics and plot positions of values and bars.
\item \code{num}: Indicator whether x is numeric.
\item \code{v}: Same as input \code{v}.
If \code{v} has length > 1, an object of class "multimarginal", which is a named
list of "marginal" objects.
}
}
\description{
Calculates average observed \code{y} values over one or multiple x variables specified
via \code{v}. \code{y} can either be a numeric vector or a column name in \code{data}.
This function is a convenience wrapper over \code{\link[=marginal]{marginal()}}.
