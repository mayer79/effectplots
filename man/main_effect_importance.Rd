\title{Main Effect Importance}
\usage{
main_effect_importance(x, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Marginal object.}

\item{by}{The statistic used to calculate the variance for.
One of 'pd', 'pred_mean', 'y_mean', or 'resid_mean\verb{. By default (}NULL`), the
first available of above list.}
}
\description{
Extracts the weighted variances of the most relevant statistic
(pd > pred_mean > y_mean > resid_mean) from a "marginal" object.
Serves as a simple measure of (main effect) importance. If partial dependence
is used, the measure is almost identical to the importance measure proposed in
the reference below.
}
\details{
If the importance cannot be calculated on a variable X (e.g., if X is constant),
its importance is set to 0.

\examples{
fit <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris)
xvars <- colnames(iris)[-1]
M <- marginal(fit, v = xvars, data = iris, y = "Sepal.Length", breaks = 5)
main_effect_importance(M)
