Description: Provides tools to create high-quality plots for model
    analysis.  The main function 'marginal()' calculates average observed
    values of the model response, average predicted values, partial
    dependence, and exposure for each feature and (possibly binned)
    feature value.  Visualization can be done via 'ggplot2' or 'plotly'.
    Optimized for speed and convenience, the package supports models with
    numeric predictions, including regression and binary classification.
    It is compatible with many models out-of-the-box, such as those
    wrapped with 'DALEX' explainers, and can be extended with custom
    prediction functions.
