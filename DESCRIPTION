Description: High-performance implementation of various effect plots
    useful for regression and probabilistic classification tasks.  The
    package includes partial dependence plots (Friedman, 2021,
    <doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451>), accumulated local effect plots and
    M-plots (both from Apley and Zhu, 2016, <doi:10.1111/rssb.12377>), as
    well as plots that describe the statistical associations between model
    response and features.  It supports visualizations with either
    'ggplot2' or 'plotly', and is compatible with most models, including
    'Tidymodels', models wrapped in 'DALEX' explainers, or models with
    case weights.
